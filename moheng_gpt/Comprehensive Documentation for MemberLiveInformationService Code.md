# Comprehensive Documentation for MemberLiveInformationService Code

## 1. Overall Structure

### High-Level Overview
The codebase is structured around the concept of managing live information associated with members. It includes domain entities, repositories for data access, DTOs for data transfer, and exception handling. The main service class, `MemberLiveInformationService`, orchestrates the interactions between these components.

### Purpose and Function of Service Code
The `MemberLiveInformationService` class is responsible for managing the relationship between members and their associated live information. It provides methods to save, update, and retrieve live information for members, ensuring data integrity and handling exceptions appropriately.

### Interaction Between Components
- **Entities**: `LiveInformation`, `MemberLiveInformation`, and `Member` represent the core data structures.
- **Repositories**: `LiveInformationRepository` and `MemberLiveInformationRepository` provide data access methods for the entities.
- **DTOs**: `FindMemberLiveInformationResponses`, `LiveInfoResponse`, and `UpdateMemberLiveInformationRequest` are used for transferring data between the service and the client.
- **Exceptions**: Custom exceptions like `NoExistLiveInformationException` and `NoExistMemberException` are thrown to handle error scenarios.

### Mermaid Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class LiveInformation {
        +Long id
        +String name
        +getId() Long
        +getName() String
    }

    class Member {
        +Long id
        +String email
        +getId() Long
    }

    class MemberLiveInformation {
        +Long id
        +LiveInformation liveInformation
        +Member member
        +getId() Long
    }

    class LiveInformationRepository {
        +Optional<LiveInformation> findByName(String liveId)
        +List<LiveInformation> findLiveInformationByTrip(Trip trip)
    }

    class MemberLiveInformationRepository {
        +List<MemberLiveInformation> findByMemberId(Long memberId)
    }

    class MemberRepository {
        +Optional<Member> findByEmail(String email)
    }

    LiveInformation --> MemberLiveInformation : contains
    Member --> MemberLiveInformation : has
    LiveInformationRepository --> LiveInformation : manages
    MemberLiveInformationRepository --> MemberLiveInformation : manages
    MemberRepository --> Member : manages
```

## 2. Strategy Pattern Implementation

### Strategy Pattern Overview
The strategy pattern is not explicitly implemented in the provided code. However, if we were to implement a strategy pattern, it could be used to define different ways of retrieving or processing live information based on varying criteria.

### Strategy Interface and Concrete Strategy Classes
- **Strategy Interface**: An interface could be defined for different retrieval strategies (e.g., `LiveInformationRetrievalStrategy`).
- **Concrete Strategies**: Implementations could include strategies for retrieving live information by member, by trip, etc.

### Context Class
The context class would be `MemberLiveInformationService`, which would use the strategy interface to delegate the retrieval of live information based on the selected strategy.

### Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class LiveInformationRetrievalStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +List<LiveInformation> retrieveLiveInformation(Long memberId)
    }

    class MemberLiveInformationService {
        +FindMemberLiveInformationResponses findMemberSelectedLiveInformation(Long memberId)
    }

    LiveInformationRetrievalStrategy <|-- MemberLiveInformationByMemberStrategy
    LiveInformationRetrievalStrategy <|-- MemberLiveInformationByTripStrategy
    MemberLiveInformationService --> LiveInformationRetrievalStrategy : uses
```

## 3. Detailed Component Documentation

### a. Classes

#### 1. LiveInformation
- **Purpose**: Represents live information with an ID and name.
- **Attributes**:
  - `Long id`: Unique identifier for the live information.
  - `String name`: Name of the live information.
- **Role**: Core entity representing live information in the system.
- **Relationships**: 
  - Has a one-to-many relationship with `MemberLiveInformation`.

#### 2. Member
- **Purpose**: Represents a member with personal details.
- **Attributes**:
  - `Long id`: Unique identifier for the member.
  - `String email`: Email of the member.
- **Role**: Core entity representing a user in the system.
- **Relationships**: 
  - Has a one-to-many relationship with `MemberLiveInformation`.

#### 3. MemberLiveInformation
- **Purpose**: Represents the association between a member and live information.
- **Attributes**:
  - `Long id`: Unique identifier for the association.
  - `LiveInformation liveInformation`: The live information associated with the member.
  - `Member member`: The member associated with the live information.
- **Role**: Entity that links members to their live information.
- **Relationships**: 
  - Many-to-one relationship with both `LiveInformation` and `Member`.

#### 4. MemberLiveInformationService
- **Purpose**: Service class for managing member live information.
- **Attributes**:
  - `MemberLiveInformationRepository memberLiveInformationRepository`: Repository for member live information.
  - `LiveInformationRepository liveInformationRepository`: Repository for live information.
  - `MemberRepository memberRepository`: Repository for members.
- **Role**: Orchestrates the logic for saving, updating, and retrieving member live information.
- **Relationships**: 
  - Uses multiple repositories to interact with the database.

### b. Methods and Functions

#### 1. saveAll
- **Purpose**: Saves a list of `MemberLiveInformation` entities.
- **Parameters**:
  - `List<MemberLiveInformation> memberLiveInformations`: List of member live information to save.
- **Return Value**: None.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  List<MemberLiveInformation> liveInfos = new ArrayList<>();
  service.saveAll(liveInfos);
  ```

#### 2. updateMemberLiveInformation
- **Purpose**: Updates the live information associated with a member.
- **Parameters**:
  - `long memberId`: ID of the member to update.
  - `UpdateMemberLiveInformationRequest request`: Request containing live information IDs.
- **Return Value**: None.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  UpdateMemberLiveInformationRequest request = new UpdateMemberLiveInformationRequest(Arrays.asList(1L, 2L));
  service.updateMemberLiveInformation(memberId, request);

  ```

## 4. Implementation Flow

### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Service
    participant Repository
    participant DTO

    Client->>Service: findMemberSelectedLiveInformation(memberId)
    Service->>Repository: findAll()
    Repository-->>Service: List<LiveInformation>
    Service->>Repository: findByMemberId(memberId)
    Repository-->>Service: List<MemberLiveInformation>
    Service->>DTO: create LiveInfoResponse
    Service-->>Client: FindMemberLiveInformationResponses
```

### Explanation of Sequence
1. The client calls `findMemberSelectedLiveInformation` on the service with a member ID.
2. The service retrieves all live information from the repository.
3. The service fetches the member's associated live information IDs.
4. The service constructs `LiveInfoResponse` DTOs based on the retrieved data.
5. Finally, the service returns a `FindMemberLiveInformationResponses` object to the client.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `MemberLiveInformationService` code, detailing its structure, purpose, and interactions, while also illustrating the implementation of the strategy pattern and the flow of operations.
