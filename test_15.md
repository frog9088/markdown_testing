# Comprehensive Documentation for the Service Code

## 1. Overall Structure

### High-Level Overview
The codebase is structured into several packages, each serving a specific domain within the application. The primary packages include:
- `moheng.keyword.domain.repository`: Contains repositories for managing `TripKeyword` entities.
- `moheng.member.domain`: Contains classes related to member management, including the `Member` entity and its repository.
- `moheng.recommendtrip.domain`: Contains classes related to recommending trips, including `RecommendTrip`, its repository, and filtering strategies.
- `moheng.trip.domain`: Contains classes related to trip management, including the `Trip` entity and its repository.

### Purpose and Function of Service Code
The service code primarily handles the business logic related to trips, keywords, and member interactions. It provides a structured way to manage data persistence and retrieval through repositories, while also implementing various strategies for filtering trips based on user preferences.

### Interaction Between Different Parts
- **Repositories**: Each repository interfaces with the database to perform CRUD operations on their respective entities.
- **Entities**: The entities represent the core data models of the application, such as `Trip`, `Member`, and `RecommendTrip`.
- **Filter Strategies**: The filtering strategies allow for dynamic selection of trip recommendations based on different criteria.

### Class Relationships
```mermaid

    class TripKeywordRepository
    class Member
    class MemberRepository
    class RecommendTrip
    class RecommendTripRepository
    class Trip
    class TripRepository
    class TripFilterStrategy
    class TripFilterStrategyProvider

    TripKeywordRepository --> TripKeyword
    MemberRepository --> Member
    RecommendTripRepository --> RecommendTrip
    TripRepository --> Trip
    TripFilterStrategyProvider --> TripFilterStrategy
```

## 2. Strategy Pattern Implementation

### Strategy Pattern Overview
The strategy pattern is implemented to allow dynamic selection of filtering strategies for trip recommendations. This enables the application to adapt to different filtering criteria without modifying the core logic.

### Strategy Interface and Concrete Strategy Classes
- **Interface**: `TripFilterStrategy`
  - Defines the contract for filtering strategies with methods to check if a strategy matches a name and to execute the filtering logic.
  
- **Concrete Strategies**: Various classes implementing `TripFilterStrategy` would be defined to provide specific filtering logic based on different criteria (not provided in the code snippet).

### Context Class
- **Class**: `TripFilterStrategyProvider`
  - This class acts as the context that uses the strategies. It holds a list of available strategies and provides a method to find a strategy by its name.

### Class Diagram for Strategy Pattern
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TripFilterStrategy {
        +boolean isMatch(String strategyName)
        +List<Trip> execute(FilterStandardInfo filterStandardInfo)
    }

    class TripFilterStrategyProvider {
        -List<TripFilterStrategy> tripFilterStrategies
        +TripFilterStrategy findTripsByFilterStrategy(String filterStrategyName)
    }

    TripFilterStrategyProvider --> TripFilterStrategy
```
