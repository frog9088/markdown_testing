# Comprehensive Documentation for the Codebase

## 1. Overall Structure

### High-Level Overview
The codebase is structured around a travel recommendation system, which includes various domain entities, repositories, and services. The main components are organized into packages that represent different domains such as `keyword`, `member`, `recommendtrip`, and `trip`. Each package contains domain models, repositories for data access, and exception handling.

### Purpose and Function of Each File/Module
- **Domain Models**: Represent the core entities of the application.
  - `TripKeyword`: Represents keywords associated with trips.
  - `Member`: Represents a user/member of the system.
  - `RecommendTrip`: Represents a recommended trip for a member.
  
- **Repositories**: Interfaces for data access using Spring Data JPA.
  - `TripKeywordRepository`: Provides methods to access `TripKeyword` data.
  - `MemberRepository`: Provides methods to access `Member` data.
  - `RecommendTripRepository`: Provides methods to access `RecommendTrip` data.
  - `TripRepository`: Provides methods to access `Trip` data.

- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for transferring data between layers.
  - `RecommendTripCreateRequest`: Represents a request to create a recommended trip.
  - `FindTripsResponse`: Represents the response containing found trips.

- **Exceptions**: Custom exceptions for error handling.
  - `NoExistMemberException`: Thrown when a member does not exist.
  - `NoExistTripException`: Thrown when a trip does not exist.

- **Filter Strategies**: Interfaces and implementations for filtering trips based on various criteria.
  - `TripFilterStrategy`: Interface for defining filtering strategies.
  - `TripFilterStrategyProvider`: Provides the appropriate filtering strategy based on the name.

### Interaction Between Components
The components interact through repositories for data access, domain models for business logic, and DTOs for data transfer. The filter strategies are used to apply different filtering logic when retrieving trips based on user preferences.

### Class Relationships Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TripKeyword {
        +Long id
        +Trip trip
        +Keyword keyword
    }

    class Member {
        +Long id
        +String email
        +String nickName
    }

    class RecommendTrip {
        +Long id
        +Member member
        +Trip trip
    }

    class Trip {
        +Long id
        +String contentId
    }

    TripKeyword --> Trip
    RecommendTrip --> Member
    RecommendTrip --> Trip
```

## 2. Strategy Pattern Implementation

### Strategy Pattern Overview
The strategy pattern is implemented to allow dynamic selection of filtering strategies for trips based on user preferences. This enables the application to apply different filtering logic without modifying the core logic of the application.

### Strategy Interface and Concrete Strategy Classes
- **Strategy Interface**: 
  - `TripFilterStrategy`: Defines the contract for filtering strategies.
    - `boolean isMatch(final String strategyName)`: Checks if the strategy matches the given name.
    - `List<Trip> execute(final FilterStandardInfo filterStandardInfo)`: Executes the filtering logic.

- **Concrete Strategy Classes**: (Not provided in the code, but expected to implement `TripFilterStrategy`)

### Context Class
- **TripFilterStrategyProvider**: Acts as the context that uses the strategies.
  - It holds a list of strategies and provides a method to find the appropriate strategy based on the name.

### Class Diagram for Strategy Pattern
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TripFilterStrategy {
        +boolean isMatch(final String strategyName)
        +List<Trip> execute(final FilterStandardInfo filterStandardInfo)
    }

    class TripFilterStrategyProvider {
        +TripFilterStrategy findTripsByFilterStrategy(final String filterStrategyName)
    }

    TripFilterStrategyProvider --> TripFilterStrategy
```
