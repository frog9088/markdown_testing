# Comprehensive Documentation for the Member Service Codebase

## 1. Overall Structure

### Overview
The Member Service codebase is part of a larger application that manages user accounts and their associated data. It provides functionalities for user registration, profile management, and authority checks. The code is structured into several packages, each serving a specific purpose.

### Purpose and Function
The primary purpose of the Member Service is to handle operations related to members, including:
- User registration and profile updates
- Checking for duplicate nicknames
- Retrieving user information and authority

### Interaction Between Components
The main components of the codebase include:
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used for transferring data between layers (e.g., `MemberResponse`, `FindMemberAuthorityAndProfileResponse`).
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic (e.g., `MemberService`).
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses (e.g., `MemberController`).
- **Annotations**: Custom annotations for authentication (`@Authentication`, `@InitAuthentication`).

### Mermaid Diagram
```mermaid

    class MemberController {
        +getUserInfo()
        +signupProfile()
        +signupLiveInfo()
        +signupInterestTrip()
        +checkDuplicateNickname()
        +updateMemberProfile()
        +findMemberAuthorityAndProfileImg()
    }

    class MemberService {
        +findById()
        +signUpByProfile()
        +signUpByLiveInfo()
        +signUpByInterestTrips()
        +checkIsAlreadyExistNickname()
        +updateByProfile()
        +findMemberAuthorityAndProfileImg()
    }

    class Accessor {
        +getId()
    }

    MemberController --> MemberService
    MemberController --> Accessor
```

## 2. Strategy Pattern Implementation

### Strategy Pattern Overview
The strategy pattern is not explicitly implemented in the provided codebase. However, the use of different request handling methods in the `MemberService` can be seen as a form of strategy where different strategies (methods) are applied based on the type of request.

### Context Class
The `MemberService` class acts as the context that uses various strategies (methods) to handle member-related operations.

### Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class MemberService {
        +signUpByProfile()
        +signUpByLiveInfo()
        +signUpByInterestTrips()
    }

    class SignUpProfileRequest
    class SignUpLiveInfoRequest
    class SignUpInterestTripsRequest

    MemberService --> SignUpProfileRequest
    MemberService --> SignUpLiveInfoRequest
    MemberService --> SignUpInterestTripsRequest
```

## 3. Detailed Component Documentation

### a. Classes

#### 1. Accessor
- **Purpose**: Represents an authenticated user's identifier.
- **Attributes**:
  - `Long id`: The unique identifier for the user.
- **Role**: Used in controller methods to retrieve the authenticated user's ID.
- **Relationships**: Used in `MemberController` for authentication.

#### 2. MemberService
- **Purpose**: Contains business logic for member-related operations.
- **Attributes**:
  - `MemberRepository memberRepository`: Repository for member data.
  - `MemberLiveInformationService memberLiveInformationService`: Service for managing live information.
  - `TripService tripService`: Service for managing trips.
  - `RecommendTripService recommendTripService`: Service for managing recommended trips.
  - `LiveInformationRepository liveInformationRepository`: Repository for live information.
  - `MemberTripRepository memberTripRepository`: Repository for member trips.
- **Role**: Central service for handling member operations.
- **Relationships**: Interacts with various repositories and services.

### b. Methods and Functions

#### 1. `findById(Long id)`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a member by their ID.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `Long id`: The ID of the member to find.
- **Return Value**: `MemberResponse`: The response containing member details.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  MemberResponse response = memberService.findById(1L);
  ```

#### 2. `signUpByProfile(long memberId, SignUpProfileRequest request)`
- **Purpose**: Signs up a member using profile information.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `long memberId`: The ID of the member.
  - `SignUpProfileRequest request`: The request containing profile data.
- **Return Value**: `void`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  memberService.signUpByProfile(1L, new SignUpProfileRequest(...));
  ```

#### 3. `checkIsAlreadyExistNickname(String nickname)`
- **Purpose**: Checks if a nickname already exists.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `String nickname`: The nickname to check.
- **Return Value**: `void`
- **Example**:
  ```java
  memberService.checkIsAlreadyExistNickname("newNickname");
  ```

## 4. Implementation Flow

### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant MemberController
    participant MemberService
    participant Accessor

    Client->>MemberController: getUserInfo()
    MemberController->>Accessor: getId()
    Accessor-->>MemberController: return id
    MemberController->>MemberService: findById(id)
    MemberService-->>MemberController: return MemberResponse
    MemberController-->>Client: return MemberResponse
```

### Explanation
1. The client sends a request to `MemberController` to get user information.
2. The controller retrieves the authenticated user's ID using the `Accessor`.
3. The controller calls the `MemberService` to find the member by ID.
4. The service returns the member details encapsulated in a `MemberResponse`.
5. Finally, the controller sends the response back to the client.
