  - Classes like `Accessor`, `FindMemberLiveInformationResponses`, `UpdateMemberLiveInformationRequest`, and `LiveInfoResponse` facilitate data transfer between layers.
  
- **Service Layer**: 
  - `MemberLiveInformationService` contains the business logic for managing member live information and interacts with repositories for data access.

- **Controller Layer**: 
  - `MemberLiveInformationController` handles incoming HTTP requests and communicates with the service layer to process these requests.

- **Interactions**:
  - The controller calls methods in the service layer to handle requests.
  - The service layer uses repositories to perform database operations.
  - DTOs are exchanged between the controller and service layers to transfer data.

#### 3. Authentication Flow from Client Request to Token Generation
- **Flow Overview**:
  1. **Client Request**: The client sends a request to the controller (e.g., GET or PUT requests).
  2. **Controller Processing**: The controller receives the request and invokes the appropriate method in the service layer.
  3. **Service Logic**: The service processes the request, performing necessary validations and data manipulations, often involving repository calls to access or update the database.
  4. **Response Generation**: The service returns a response (e.g., `FindMemberLiveInformationResponses`) back to the controller.
  5. **Client Response**: The controller sends the final response back to the client, indicating success or failure of the operation.
