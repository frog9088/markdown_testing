# Comprehensive Documentation for the Service Code

## 1. Overall Structure

### High-Level Overview
The service code is part of a larger application that manages members, trips, and live information. It provides functionalities for member registration, profile updates, and managing member interests in trips and live information.

### Purpose and Function
The `MemberService` class is responsible for handling member-related operations, including:
- Finding members by ID or email.
- Signing up members with profiles, live information, and interests in trips.
- Updating member profiles.
- Managing member privileges.

### Interaction Between Components
- **MemberService** interacts with:
  - **MemberRepository**: For CRUD operations on members.
  - **LiveInformationService**: To manage live information related to members.
  - **TripService**: To handle trips associated with members.
  - **RecommendTripService**: To manage recommended trips for members.
  - **MemberLiveInformationService**: To save live information for members.
  - **MemberTripRepository**: To manage member-trip relationships.

### Mermaid Diagram
```mermaid

    class MemberService {
        +findById(Long id)
        +signUpByProfile(long memberId, SignUpProfileRequest request)
        +signUpByLiveInfo(long memberId, SignUpLiveInfoRequest request)
        +signUpByInterestTrips(long memberId, SignUpInterestTripsRequest request)
        +updateByProfile(long memberId, UpdateProfileRequest request)
    }

    class MemberRepository {
        +findById(Long id)
        +existsByEmail(String email)
        +existsByNickName(String nickname)
    }

    class LiveInformationService {
        +saveAll(List<MemberLiveInformation> memberLiveInformations)
    }

    class TripService {
        +findByContentId(Long contentId)
    }

    class RecommendTripService {
        +saveByRank(Trip trip, Member member, long rank)
    }

    class MemberLiveInformationService {
        +saveAll(List<MemberLiveInformation> memberLiveInformations)
    }

    class MemberTripRepository {
        +save(MemberTrip memberTrip)
    }

    MemberService --> MemberRepository
    MemberService --> LiveInformationService
    MemberService --> TripService
    MemberService --> RecommendTripService
    MemberService --> MemberLiveInformationService
    MemberService --> MemberTripRepository
```

## 2. Strategy Pattern Implementation

### Strategy Pattern Overview
The strategy pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. In this codebase, the strategy pattern is applied in the context of trip filtering and recommendation strategies.

### Strategy Interface and Concrete Strategy Classes
- **TripFilterStrategy**: An interface that defines the method for executing a filtering strategy.
- **TripFilterStrategyProvider**: A provider class that returns the appropriate strategy based on the given criteria.

### Context Class
- **TripService**: This class uses the `TripFilterStrategyProvider` to obtain the appropriate filtering strategy and execute it based on the current context (e.g., finding similar trips).

### Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TripFilterStrategy {
        +execute(FilterInfo filterInfo)
    }

    class TripFilterStrategyProvider {
        +findTripsByFilterStrategy(String strategyType)
    }

    class TripService {
        +findWithSimilarOtherTrips(long tripId, long memberId)
    }

    TripService --> TripFilterStrategyProvider
    TripService --> TripFilterStrategy
```

## 3. Detailed Component Documentation

### a. Classes

### b. Methods and Functions

#### findById
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a member by their ID.
- **Parameters**:
  - `id` (Long): The ID of the member to find.
- **Return Value**: `MemberResponse`: A response object containing member details.
- **Example**:
